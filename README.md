# Python-NumPy-Basics

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook is designed to provide hands-on exercises for mastering basic Python programming and utilizing the Numpy library. It contains a series of programming tasks that highlight the core functionalities of Python and Numpy, offering an interactive way to learn and apply these tools in machine learning contexts.

## Features
  - **Python Basics:** Exercises covering fundamental Python programming concepts, including data structures and list operations.
  - **Numpy Exercises:** Tasks that demonstrate the usage of Numpy for numerical operations, crucial for data science and machine learning.
  - **Interactive Learning:** Each section includes practical tasks to solve, promoting active learning and immediate application of concepts.

## Usage
Run the notebook cells sequentially from top to bottom. Each cell either contains text explaining concepts and tasks or Python code that can be executed to demonstrate these concepts. Adjustments or additions to the code can be made to experiment with different Python and Numpy functionalities.

## Prerequisites
  - Python 3.x
  - Numpy library (preferably version 1.17.0 or later)
  - Jupyter Notebook environment

## Input
Inputs will vary depending on the task within the notebook. Most exercises will use simple data structures like lists or numpy arrays that are defined within the notebook itself.

## Output
Outputs are typically the results of Python code executions demonstrating data manipulations using Python and Numpy. This may include printed outputs, manipulated data structures, or computed numerical results.

## Notes
  - Ensure that all necessary packages are installed before running the notebook (use `pip install numpy` if numpy is not installed).
  - The notebook links to official documentation of Python and Numpy, which can be referred to for more detailed explanations of functions and methods used.
  - It's encouraged to modify the code and try different variations to fully grasp the functionalities of Python and Numpy.
